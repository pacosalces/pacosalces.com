### "_Spatial coherence of spin-orbit-coupled Bose gases_"
#### (Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 053605)
Different matter waves may interfere provided they are "coherent" with each other, producing atomic density "ripples" or interference fringes when made to overlap. The contrast and duration of this interference pattern is subject to _decoherence_; the result of unwanted perturbations which modulate the phase randomly. Multi-spin (or spinor) gases do not render an interference pattern even if their motional state is coherent (if they originated from the same Bose-Einstein condensate), but when dressed by spin-dependent kicks (spin-orbit coupling dispersion) where the motional and spin degrees of freedom are coupled, a new phase of matter known as "stripe" phase describes the ability of these new states to mix coherently. The experimental signature appears as interference fringes, or stripes, and depends strongly on the coupling strength and inherent spinor miscibility (how homogeneous or heterogeneously will the two spins mix). In a fantastic effort led by A. Putra, we probe striped phases by using the stripes as a Bragg mirror so that by shining a laser at the right angle the reflected light beam allows us to detect, and even keep track of the spatial coherence in this gas. 
_Key finding_: We observed stripe-phases that lived far longer than expected from decoherence, indicating better-than expected spatial coherence in our system.

### "_Equations of state from individual one-dimensional Bose gases_" 
#### (New Journal of Physics 20 (11), 113032)
We put contact interacting bosons into the one-dimensional (1D) regime; where all dynamics happen preferentially along one direction and at low enough densities "repel each other" like fermions. To achieve this, we start with an ultracold, three-dimensional (3D) Bose gas, e.g. a Rb-87 Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) where three characteristic energy scales exist; 1) the thermal energy scale associated with the temperature of the gas, 2) the harmonic level energy spacing associated with our trap, and 3) the mean-field energy scale associated with the short-range interactions. We freeze two degrees of freedom with a repulsive optical dipole trap (tweezer) shaped like a donut (LG-01 mode). The resulting trumpet-shaped potential squeezes atoms along two dimensions, leaving only the longitudinal one free. Then, we determine the thermodynamic state of our 1D gas by taking images of the resulting density distributions. Because we know the shape of the trapping potential, we can connect the observed local density with a local chemical potential, and a global unknown temperature. Relating such "state variables" comprises an equation of state.
_Key finding_: We discover that loading the same 1D traps with warmer 3D gases results in colder 1D gases! Furthermore, by waiting for some time we see that the most energetic bosons leave the 1D trap, resulting in a net evaporative cooling. While the 1D temperature drops, the once degenerate bosons actually escape degeneracy! We speculate this is due to the inefficient chasing of the critical temperature in 1D vs 3D, where evaporative cooling results in an efficient approach trajectory to degeneracy.

### "_Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole_" 
#### (Science 360 (6396), 1429-1434)
Here we work with 4 of the 8 internal spin states in the hyperfine ground manifold of ultracold 87-Rb. After preparing an initial state superposition, we drive it coherently along a parametric trajectory (i.e. described by the parameters of an external field) such that the final state acquires matrix-valued geometric phases. These matrix-valued phase factors do not commute with each other (i.e. they are non-Abelian) and may be used to reveal the structure of a gauge field in the parameter space, as they relate to the "flux" of a geometric gauge field. Integrating the "flux" counts the number of "sources", an integer number known as "second Chern number". The importance of this number is that it characterizes the topology of the non-Abelian gauge field, finding more relevance in less abstract settings where the parameter space is related to the crystalline band structure of an exotic material. 

### "_Charge exchange x-ray emission: Astrophysical observations and potential diagnostics_"
#### (AIP Conference Proceedings 1525 (1), 49-54)
Comets have tails which grow especially large when they come closer to the sun. A comet's tail will point away from the sun, regardless of its trajectory. But, what are they made of, and can we use that information to better understand them? Given how rare one of these objects visits our solar system neighborhood, accelerator physics and X-ray spectroscopy can teach us something. In this AIP conference proceedings, we report on Lymann-series ratios from direct X-ray calorimetry of charge exchange processes. To do this, we collide ions emulating the solar wind with neutral gas backgrounds representing the gases present in the thin atmosphere of a comet. The charged ions undergo a process called charge exchange, usually followed by an electronic decay event that radiates soft X-rays (keV). For the sake of spectral resolution, we use a calorimeter which at the cost of slow detection rate can resolve all the Lymann emission lines. For this study, C-6+ ions were used on three different neutral backgrounds.
