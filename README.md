## Human-readable summary of co-authored publications (for truly accurate renditions refer to the peer-reviewed publications abstracts)



### "_Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole_" 
#### (Science 360 (6396), 1429-1434)
Here we work with 4 of the 8 internal spin states in the hyperfine ground manifold of ultracold 87-Rubidium. After preparing an initial state, we drive it coherently along a parametric trajectory (i.e. described by the parameters of an external field) such that the final state acquires matrix-valued geometric phases. These matrix-valued phase factors do not commute with each other (i.e. non-Abelian) and reveal the structure of a gauge field in the abstract parameter space. Integrating the "flux" from the reconstructed gauge field strength counts the number of sources, represented by the "second Chern number". The importance of this number is that it characterizes the topological character of the non-Abelian gauge field, finding more relevance in less abstract settings where the parameter space is related to the crystalline band structure of an exotic material. 

### "_Charge exchange x-ray emission: Astrophysical observations and potential diagnostics_"
#### (AIP Conference Proceedings 1525 (1), 49-54)
Comets have tails which grow especially large when they come closer to the sun. A comet's tail will point away from the sun, regardless of its trajectory. But, what are they made of, and can we use that information to better understand them? Given how rare one of these objects visits our solar system neighborhood, accelerator physics and X-ray spectroscopy can teach us something. In this AIP conference proceedings, we report on Lymann-series ratios from direct X-ray calorimetry of charge exchange processes. To do this, we collide ions emulating the solar wind with neutral gas backgrounds representing the gases present in the thin atmosphere of a comet. The charged ions undergo a process called charge exchange, usually followed by an electronic decay event that radiates soft X-rays (keV). For the sake of spectral resolution, we use a calorimeter which at the cost of slow detection rate can resolve all the Lymann emission lines. For this study, C-6+ ions were used on three different neutral backgrounds.
