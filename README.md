### Welcome!

This is my personal website. Even though it is kind of empty right now, I plan to add content steadily. For now, feel free to check my professional [CV](https://pacosalces.github.io/docs/salces_carcoba.pdf). Also feel free to go to my public [repositories](https://github.com/pacosalces) for my most recent projects!

### Human-readable summary of co-authored publications (for truly accurate renditions refer to the peer-reviewed publications abstracts)

## "_Second Chern number of a quantum-simulated non-Abelian Yang monopole_" (Science 360 (6396), 1429-1434)
Here we work with 4 of the 8 internal spin states in the hyperfine ground manifold of ultracold 87-Rubidium. After preparing an initial state, we drive it coherently along a parametric trajectory (i.e. described by the parameters of an external field) such that the final state acquires matrix-valued geometric phases. These matrix-valued phase factors do not commute with each other (i.e. non-Abelian) and reveal the structure of a gauge field in the abstract parameter space. Integrating the "flux" from the reconstructed gauge field strength counts the number of sources, represented by the "second Chern number". The importance of this number is that it characterizes the topological character of the non-Abelian gauge field, finding more relevance in less abstract settings where the parameter space is related to the crystalline band structure of an exotic material.
