### Welcome!

This is my personal website. Even though it is kind of empty right now, I plan to add content steadily. For now, feel free to check my professional [CV](https://pacosalces.github.io/docs/salces_carcoba.pdf). Also feel free to go to my public [repositories](https://github.com/pacosalces) for my most recent projects!

### Support or Contact
You should know where to find me if you made it up to here. If not, feel free to email me at pacosc@terpmail.umd.edu
